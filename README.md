# SomeBitBot
A twitter Bot using node.js and the Twit package.
It uses Waqi API for posting each hour a tweet providing information about the air quality in Bogota city. 
It makes use of the Aylien Text Analysis API to express an opinion based on the text of a tweet.
You can mention @SomeBitBot on your tweet and it will give an opinion: Positive, neutral or negative.

 
### Tech
* [Waqi] - Waqi API to get Air Quality Index information.
* [Aylien] - Natural Language Processing API.
* [Twitter API] - For making requests and responses. 
* [node.js] - Backend Server.
* [Express] - node.js network app framework.
* [Request] - Used to make http/https calls.

 
### Installation

SomeBitBot requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.
Install the dependencies and run bot.js

```sh
$ npm install 
$ node bot.js
``` 
Note that you may need to insert your own API credentials.

Twitter API
```sh
var T = new Twit({
  consumer_key:         'your_consumer_key',
  consumer_secret:      'your_consumer_secret',
  access_token:         'your_access_token',
  access_token_secret:  'your_ access_token_secret',
});
```

  application_id: "your_application_id",

});
``` 


## The bot in action
### Air quality in the city
The bot will post each hour a tweet providing information about the air quality and the average temperatue of 5 locations (Usaqu√©n, Guaymaral, Suba, Las Ferias, Puente Aranda) in Bogota city. Depending on the Air Quality Index the tweet will display a message indicating if the air quality is: satisfactory üçÉ, moderate ‚ö†Ô∏è or bad ‚õîÔ∏è. 
* Please note that sometimes Twitter will prevend the bot from tweeting if the information of the post has already been tweeted in the past. 

### Natural Language Processing and tweeting a response based on sentiment
When someone in a tweet mentions @SomeBitBot, it will take the information from that tweet and use the Aylien text analysis API to determine the sentiment expressed in the tweet. The response from the Aylien API can be: "positive", "neutral" or "negative". Based on this the bot will tweet back a reply.
* The API also allows to know the language of the tweet. With this information the bot determines if the reply message will be sent in English or in Spanish.
